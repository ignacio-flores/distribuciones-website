construida y cuenta con una amplia cobertura geográfica y temporal.
Hemos recopilado datos de fuentes confiables y los hemos procesado de
manera rigurosa para asegurar su calidad y coherencia.</p>
<p>Para facilitar la exploración, hemos organizado los conjuntos de
datos en diferentes categorías, lo que te permitirá encontrar
rápidamente lo que estás buscando. Además, hemos preparado documentos
complementarios, como diccionarios de códigos y descripciones
detalladas, para ayudar a comprender mejor las variables.</p>

<h1>Datos de ingreso</h1>
<p>Los datos de ingreso que encontrarás en este sitio corresponden al
estudio: <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X24002079?via%3Dihub">More
Unequal or Not as Rich? Revisiting the Latin American Exception</a>. El
artículo examina la distribución de ingresos en América Latina y desafía
la creencia comúnmente aceptada de que la región es una excepción a las
tendencias globales de creciente desigualdad. Para abordar esta
pregunta, construimos la base de datos más completa hasta la fecha, que
abarca el 80% de la población de la región y combina encuestas
armonizadas, datos de seguridad social, declaraciones de impuestos sobre
la renta y cuentas nacionales. Como resultado, ponemos a disposición
cuatro documentos para su descarga. Nuestras estimaciones cubren el
período 2000-2020.</p>
